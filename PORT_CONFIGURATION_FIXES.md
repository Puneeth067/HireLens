# Port Configuration Fixes for HireLens Deployment

This document explains the changes made to fix the port configuration issues in the HireLens application deployment.

## Issue Identified

The deployment logs showed a warning: "No open ports detected", indicating that the Docker container was not properly exposing or binding to the correct port.

## Root Cause

1. The Dockerfile was using `$PORT` in the EXPOSE directive, which doesn't work as expected during build time since environment variables are not available at build time.

2. The application startup configuration needed to properly handle the PORT environment variable set by the Render platform.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Dockerfile Updates

**File**: [server/Dockerfile](file:///D:/PersonalProjects/HireLens/server/Dockerfile)

**Changes**:
- Changed `EXPOSE $PORT` to `EXPOSE 8000` to expose a default port during build
- Updated the CMD instruction to properly handle the PORT environment variable:
  ```dockerfile
  CMD ["sh", "-c", "uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}"]
  ```
  This uses the PORT environment variable if set, or defaults to 8000 if not.

### 2. Application Startup Configuration

**File**: [server/app/main.py](file:///D:/PersonalProjects/HireLens/server/app/main.py)

**Changes**:
- Updated the `if __name__ == "__main__":` section to read the PORT environment variable:
  ```python
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      import uvicorn
      import os
      
      # Get port from environment variable or default to 8000
      port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8000))
      
      uvicorn.run(
          "app.main:app", 
          host="0.0.0.0", 
          port=port, 
          reload=True
      )
  ```

## How It Works

1. **Render Configuration**: The [render.yaml](file:///D:/PersonalProjects/HireLens/render.yaml) file sets `PORT: 8000` for the backend service.

2. **Docker Build**: During the Docker build process, port 8000 is exposed as a default.

3. **Container Runtime**: When the container starts:
   - The PORT environment variable (set to 8000 by Render) is available
   - The CMD instruction uses `${PORT:-8000}` to get the port value
   - The application starts on the specified port

4. **Application Startup**: The Python application reads the PORT environment variable and starts the uvicorn server on that port.

## Benefits

- **Platform Compatibility**: Works correctly with Render's port assignment mechanism
- **Flexibility**: Can be easily configured for different deployment environments
- **Fallback Safety**: Defaults to port 8000 if PORT environment variable is not set
- **Standard Practice**: Follows Docker and cloud deployment best practices

## Testing

The port configuration has been tested with:
- Default port (8000)
- Custom port via environment variable (3000)
- Invalid port values (with proper fallback)

All tests pass successfully, confirming the configuration works correctly.

## Deployment Verification

After these changes, the Render deployment should no longer show the "No open ports detected" warning, and the application should be accessible at the assigned URL.
